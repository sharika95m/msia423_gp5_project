# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Overview

On a high-level, the aim of the project is to analyze and build a Machine Learning model from data on Customer Churn at a telecom company based on data from website ([LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datazng/telecom-company-churn-rate-call-center-data)). 

1. Acquiring the data from website (**Need to add**)
2. Cleaning the data
3. Creating new features using existing data
4. Building basic visualizations (**Need to add**)
5. Creating train and test dataset
6. Building a machine learning model to predict of Customer Churn
7. Making predictions on all customers in database
8. Evaluating the model on certain metrics
9. Uploading all project deliverables to an AWS s3 bucket

Before proceeding further, 
- [ ] Please create S3 bucket on your AWS Console with either bucket name of your choice or msia423-gp5-project

- [ ] If you chose to create an S3 bucket with bucket name of your choice, please update the YAML file. Under AWS section, update the bucket_name.
